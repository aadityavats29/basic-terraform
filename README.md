Troubleshooting
"Unsupported argument" errors about cpu_core_count, cpu_threads_per_core, or block_duration_minutes

    Cause: Older module versions or files may use deprecated or removed arguments.

    Solution: Upgrade to the versions shown above and delete/remove those argument lines from any local module source or override.
